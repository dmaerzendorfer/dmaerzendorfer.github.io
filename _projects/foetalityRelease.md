## Intro

<a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457480/Foetality_Fetus_Deletus/">**Foetality: Fetus Deletus**</a> is the updated and published version of <a href= "{{site.url}}/projects/foetalityGameJam/">FÃ¶tality</a> which was created during a game jam.  After tinkering and polishing the jam prototype for about a year besides our studies we released it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457480/Foetality_Fetus_Deletus/">steam</a>.

It is still a whacky local couch multiplayer in which players have to cannibalise their siblings in their mothers womb. However, during development a few changes have been made. It now supports:
- multiple rounds
- up to four players
- better physics
- a new shouting game mechanic
- a lobby 
- a training mode
- a tutorial
- a new menu with settings and localisation in two languages (german, english)
- commentator kidneys that react to the gameplay
- new soundtracks and sfx 
- and overall better art, sound and juicinessðŸ¤—

The gameplay itself is roughly the same though: Dash into players, spam buttons to gnaw off limbs. Be the last survivor to win. However, players can now shout to knock other players away.
