## Intro

I wanted to try some vector art. So I created a little illustration for my game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457480/Foetality_Fetus_Deletus/">Foetality</a>!

For making it I used the free [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)!
It as a nice process of getting to know the software. I am only scratching the edge here, but I got some usefull knowledge and might make some more vector art whenever I need any.

### Result

I started out with a simple sketch of what I was looking for and then vectorized it. The result is no way near perfect, but I think it's a good start.
