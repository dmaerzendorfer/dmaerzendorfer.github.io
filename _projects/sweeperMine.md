## Intro

Some time ago I was lucky enough to dig up a build of one of my earliest games I ever made! It is called **SweeperMine** and is a Minesweeper clone. The project is quite simple and it was an assignment back in high school when I was about 18 years old. 

It's not too impressive but I would like to document it here :)

Back then the inspiration for this project was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">this video </a> on juice in games. So I took a simple minesweeper and tried to make it a bit juicier with some sounds, little tweens and cute cats.


The game can be tried out <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/builds/sweeperMine/SweeperMine_build/index.html">here.</a>
