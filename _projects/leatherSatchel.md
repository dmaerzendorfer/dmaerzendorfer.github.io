A while back I made a hand-sewn leather satchel. For a while now I was searching for one so I can store some of the leftover marbles from my <a href= "{{site.url}}/projects/slothShot/">Sloth-Shot</a> project.

I never found one but since I like to hand-sew and and my mum had lots of leather and a leather sewing kit lying around I made one myself!

It was quite straight forward, first I had to find a good pattern online. Then I watched some tutorials on how to saddle-stitch. A nice crafting evening later, I had the satchel I wanted!
