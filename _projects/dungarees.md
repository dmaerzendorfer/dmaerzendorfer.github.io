I recently sewed a pair of dungarees with my mother! So basically I had time on my hand and wanted some nice clothes. They are based on a pattern by <a href="https://thefoldline.com/products/i-am-patterns-mens-colibri-dungarees">the fold line</a>.

We started out with a prototype version that are dungaree shorts. The pattern was a bit head-scratching every now and then, but the result is quite nice :)

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/dungarees/pattern.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/dungarees/result.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/dungarees/resultOnMe.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
   
</div>
<div class="caption">
