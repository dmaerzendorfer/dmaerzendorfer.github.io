## Intro

This project is a real short one. It is actually just an old assignment I did during my ITS Bachelor course at the FH Salzburg. Now four years later after this particuliar assignment I still remember having fun with this one, so I thought I want to display it here :)

The assignment itself is a simple Memory-Manager coded in C that supports different strategies (FirstFit, NextFit and BestFit) for allocating memory.

The code for it can be founde <a href="https://github.com/dmaerzendorfer/MemoryManagement/tree/main">here</a>.
