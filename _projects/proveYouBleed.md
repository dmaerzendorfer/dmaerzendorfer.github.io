## Intro

<a href="https://maerzy.itch.io/prove-you-bleed">Prove You Bleed</a> is a local two player fighting game. It features two monsters stabbing each other, however they are only allowed to stab once they solve a captcha! It was created during the <a href="https://hagenberg-gamejam.at/">2025 Hagenberg Game Jam</a> in 36h. The topic of the jam was **artificial stupidity**, hence the captchas. The game was made with **Unity 6**.

The controls are simple, player one uses the wasd-keys and player two the arrow-keys. It features three different captcha mini-games:
- stab the heart
- push the nail into the eye
- crawl the bug into the brain

The last planned captcha, chopping up arms, sadly did not make it in 🥲

## Learnings
Overall the jam went well, tho I was a bit swamped with work, being the only programmer with four artists. As a result the game is more art heavy than mechanic heavy.
Some final asset integration had to happened after the jam, next time I will plan more time for integration!

However, I am happy to have worked with such amazing artists!
