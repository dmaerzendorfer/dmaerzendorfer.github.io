## Intro

<a href="https://sinaistanders.itch.io/lost-singnl">Lost Sin(gnl)</a> is a local coop game for two players about recreating a target signal by adjusting two sine waves and additive synthesis. It was created at the 12th <a href="https://itch.io/jam/12th-mmarmalade">MMArmalade</a> game jam in 48 hours. The game was created in Unity and is played on a single gamepad.

The topic of the jam was:

<h1 style="text-align:center"><b>Lost Signal</b></h1>

Before the game jam we decided to create a retro game. In the end however we created a game with a soviet wave pixel style. Our players are agents in the cold war and need to decypher messages via additive synthesis of two sine waves. Each player controls their own sine wave by changing its frequency and phase. The waves are then added together to match a target wave. With each matched wave they get to listen to a new decyphered message and increase their score. By synchronously pressing their joystick players can also smack the decyphering osciloscope to generate a new target wave. Players try to get a highscore in two minutes.

The gameloop is very simple, however it stars an interesting mechanic of additive synthesis and players also get to listen to the live signal they are creating. The whole game is supported by a moody environment and atmosphere.

The game also won the **best game mechanic** award of the jam :)
