## Intro

<a href="https://wahoza.itch.io/trenchcoat">Trenchc(o)at</a> is a local coop game for three players about cats that hide in a trenchcoat and need to do some shopping. It was created at the 11th <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mmarmalade11">MMArmalade</a> game jam in 48 hours.

The topic of the jam was:

<h1 style="text-align:center"><b>Transform</b></h1>

To incorporate this our players are able to leave and enter a trenchcoat, which in turn transforms their appearance as well as their control scheme since they control the trenchcoat together. Overall, the game is a stealth game where the players need to collect the items on their shopping list without being noticed by the other customers. In order to pay for their errands they also need to steal money from said customers! The game can be played with up to three players.

## Team
- Sina Anders: Art

- Isabelle Posch: Art
- Elias Tieber: Audio

As you can see we had a pretty big team for a game jam. This was also the biggest learning from the jam, next time I will aim for a smaller team ^^'
Due to the team size the end result of the jam was rather rushed and had lots of bugs, I also had to stifle my own quality standards to get it somewhat running. However, in the end it was enough to obtain the third place in the ranking. So all in all a successful game jam I say!
