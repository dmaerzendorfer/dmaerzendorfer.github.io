## Intro

At some point during my Master studies I realised that I want to have a portfolio page to display my projects and host my CV. Since my graphic design skills are a bit lackluster I wanted to have a template for this that is easily extendable. Additionally I wanted to host it myself. 

After some searching I found the perfect solution for me: 
<p style="text-align:center"><b>a Jekyll page hosted on github!</b></p>


This is what you are looking at right now! Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain markdown files into static websites. It allows me to host it on github and super easily manage and create new posts! Furthermore there are plenty templates on the web one can pick up an change to their liking.

For my first version I was using the now called <a href="https://github.com/TolgaTatli/Moonrise">Moonrise</a> template. Later on I updated to the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> template. Wherever needed I also adjusted the design to my own needs by adjusting some HTML and CSS. With that project I also learnt a bit about ruby which was neat.

Even tho I am not too fond of web development I did quite enjoy making and tweaking this. It might not be the most beatiful but it is just perfect for what I want it to do. It also gave me the opertunity to use my web dev knowledge :D
