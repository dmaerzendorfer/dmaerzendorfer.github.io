## Intro

During my MA Studies in Hagenberg I joined the local Animation-Jam. This was my first experience with such a jam. Sadly however I only had time for measly 9 hours. Due to that I told myself I will just join solo so I don't drag a team down... You can image were that led to.

## Result
It led to this! A partial result of an audio visualiser I made 100% in blender that I never finished since I didn't have enough time for the whole rendering! 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/img/firstAnimJam/FinalResult.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true%}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    I ran out of time so I only rendered one third of the actual audio clip. The result is also a bit crude and rushed at times.
</div>

## Some more Info

So I set out to this jam already knowing my limitations that I am solo and only have limited time. So I decided to create an audio visualiser with generative animations. In addition to that I wanted to try out the newly released **Blender 5**, in the end I did try it out and its new SDF-Grid nodes to create my orbs.

The theme of the jam was **"Lights on"** by the way, I tried to at least somewhat incorporate this in the intro by adding the floodlight sound. I actually quite like that detail.

For the audio I planned to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2keRbBm0NQ">Quest by KV</a> which I found on <a href="https://audiolibrary.com.co">Audio Library</a>.

## Learnings

I learnt alot about **Blender** in general, **Geo-Nodes** and most importantly that **rendering takes looooooong**. 

But I think if I had more time for the jam (or a render farm) it would have worked out nicely. 
This jam also showed me why I like game engines so much: ***They can render in realtime!***
