## Intro

Oasis was an assignment project for my Master studies in Salzburg. The task was to create a small mobile game prototype in godot whilst utilising mobile specific sensors, such as the gyro. 

This lead to the creation of Oasis. Oasis is a simple puzzle game where one needs to redirect a river to an oasis whilst avoiding static obstacles (the blue boxes). The redirection can be done via touching the river and dragging or tilting the phone.

In addition the prototype makes use of android specific features such as muting the games music once spotify is started or a call is received. For this an android plugin was written that is imported into godot.

Tho it is a really small and clunky prototype I liked the idea of Oasis. Perhaps I will revisit this project at some point :)
